SUMMARY:Programming Assignment Unit 2 is due
DESCRIPTION:USING IDLE\n\nIDLE is a particular Integrated Development Envir
	onment (IDE) that is typically included in a Python installation. An IDE wi
	ll enable you to use a text editor to create programs (in the case of Pytho
	n\, we refer to the program as a SCRIPT) as well as execute the program. Th
	e IDLE editor understands the syntax of the Python programming language and
	 can help you to debug your program by identifying code that is not valid a
	nd must be corrected.\n\nWhen you first start IDLE\, it will display a wind
	ow that is the Python interpreter. You can type Python commands directly in
	to this environment\, and Python will interpret and execute them.\n\nFor al
	l of the assignments in this course\, you must create a SCRIPT. To create a
	 script\, select "New window" from the "File" menu. This will open a new sc
	ript file. You can also use the "Open" or "Recent files" options under the 
	"File" menu to open files that you have previously created.\n\nYou can ente
	r your script into the window that opens when you use the "New window" opti
	on. Before executing your script\, you must save it. The first time you att
	empt to save a new script\, you will need to give it a name. All Python scr
	ipts must have the suffix of .py on the filename.\n\nTo execute a script\, 
	you can select the "Run Module" option under the "Run" menu\, or optionally
	 press F5 on your keyboard.\n\n-------------------------\n\nASSIGNMENT\n\nU
	sing the IDLE development environment\, create a Python SCRIPT named tryme4
	.py. (Note: an alternative to IDLE is to use a free account on the pythonan
	ywhere [1] website: )\n\nIDLE has both an interactive mode and a script mod
	e. You must use the SCRIPT mode to develop your script. Your script must us
	e meaningful variable names and have comments that describe what is happeni
	ng in your script. Comments may describe the assignment of a value to a var
	iable\, a computation and the assignment of the result to a variable\, or t
	he display of the result.\n\nWrite a function in this file called nine_line
	s that uses the function three_lines (provided below) to print a total of n
	ine lines.\n\nNow add a function named clear_screen that uses a combination
	 of the functions nine_lines\, three_lines\, and new_line (provided below) 
	to print a total of twenty-five lines. The last line of your program should
	 call first nine_lines and then the clear_screen function.\n\nThe  function
	 three_lines and new_line are defined below so that you can see nested func
	tion calls. Also\, to make counting “blank” lines visually easier\, the pri
	nt command inside new_line will print a dot at the beginning of the line:\n
	\ndef new_line():\n\n    print('.')\n\ndef three_lines():\n\n    new_line()
	\n\n    new_line()\n\n    new_line()\n\nSubmit your Python script file in t
	he posting of your assignment. Your Python script should be either a .txt f
	ile or a .py file.\n\nYou must execute your script and paste the output pro
	duced into a document that you will submit along with your Python script.\n
	\nIt is very helpful if you print a placeholder between the printing of 9 l
	ines and the printing of 25 lines. It will make your output easier to read 
	for your instructor to assess. A placeholder can be output such as “Printin
	g nine lines” or “Calling clearScreen()”.\n\nGood luck coding your first pr
	ogram!\n\n-------------------------\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe following items wi
	ll be used in the grading rubric for this assignment. Make sure that you ha
	ve addressed each item in your assignment.\n\n	* Does the assignment implem
	ent new_line\, three_lines\, nine_lines\, and clear_screen functions\, as w
	ell as a main section of the program which calls the functions?\n\n	* Does 
	the assignment demonstrate the use of NESTED function calls?\n\n	* Does the
	 assignment produce the appropriate output when executed? The output should
	 be recorded in a text file\, a Microsoft Word document\, or an RTF-formatt
	ed document by copying the output from the Python script into the document.
	 The successful script will print out 9 "." lines first and then 25 "." lin
	es.\n\n	* Does the program code include comments where appropriate?\n\n----

	ding the error message.\n\n	* An explanation of the error message.\n\n	* An
